Hi 👋 My name is CJ Nicholas
==============================

Full Stack Consultant | Engineer
------------------------

Founder of CNC Consultancy. One aspect of being a software consultant that I absolutely love is the opportunity to constantly learn and adapt in a rapidly evolving industry. As a consultant, I am exposed to a wide range of projects, technologies, and clients, which keeps me on my toes and allows me to expand my knowledge and expertise. The ever-changing nature of software development means that I am constantly challenged to find innovative solutions and stay up-to-date with the latest trends. This dynamic environment fuels my passion for problem-solving and provides me with the chance to make a meaningful impact by helping clients streamline their processes, improve efficiency, and achieve their business objectives. The collaborative nature of consulting also allows me to work closely with diverse teams, fostering a rich learning environment and enabling me to build strong professional relationships.
